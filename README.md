Hospital Management System SQL Project

This project is a complete end-to-end Hospital Management System (HMS) built using PostgreSQL/MySQL, featuring a fully normalized relational schema, realistic synthetic data (1M+ records), and 50+ analytical SQL queries. It simulates real hospital operations including patients, doctors, appointments, admissions, treatments, lab tests, prescriptions, billing, and invoices. The dataset and queries are designed for learning database design, SQL analytics, performance tuning, and real-world data modeling.

Features
1. Normalized Database Schema

Includes 13+ fully structured tables:

Patients

Doctors

Departments

Rooms

Appointments

Admissions

Treatments

Medications

Prescriptions

Lab Tests

Lab Results

Invoices

Invoice Line Items

2. Large Realistic Dataset (1M+ Rows)

Automatically generated high-quality synthetic hospital data:

200k+ patients

700k+ appointments

150k+ prescriptions

100k+ lab results

150k+ invoices

300k+ invoice lines

Useful for analytics, dashboards, SQL practice, machine learning, and optimization tasks.

3. Intermediate–Advanced SQL Query Collection
